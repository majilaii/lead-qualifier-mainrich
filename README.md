## What It Does

```
CSV / Exa Search ──→ Web Crawler ──→ AI Qualifier ──→ Deep Research ──→ Output
     (find)           (scrape)        (score)          (analyze)        (CSV)
```

| Step | Module | What Happens |
|------|--------|-------------|
| **1. Discovery** | `test_exa.py` | Finds company websites matching your ideal customer profile (ICP) using [Exa AI](https://exa.ai) neural search |
| **2. Crawling** | `scraper.py` | Visits each website with a headless browser, extracts page text as markdown + takes a screenshot |
| **3. Qualification** | `intelligence.py` | LLM reads the website content + screenshot and scores 1-10 on how likely this company needs your product |
| **4. Deep Research** | `deep_research.py` | For hot leads (score 8+), crawls multiple pages and generates a sales brief: products they make, who to talk to, what to say |
| **5. Enrichment** | `enrichment.py` | Looks up contact emails/phones via Apollo.io or Hunter.io (optional, manual mode by default) |
| **6. Export** | `export.py` | Combines results into Excel or Google Sheets |

### Output

Leads are automatically sorted into 3 buckets:

| File | Score | Action |
|------|-------|--------|
| `output/qualified_hot_leads.csv` | 8-10 🔥 | Ready for outreach |
| `output/review_manual_check.csv` | 4-7 🔍 | Human review needed |
| `output/rejected_with_reasons.csv` | 1-3 ❌ | Not a fit (with explanation) |

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11+**
- **At least one LLM API key** (see Step 2)

### 1. Clone & Set Up Environment

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd lead-qualifier

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
# venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install browser for web crawling
playwright install chromium
```

### 2. Configure API Keys

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and add your keys. **You need at minimum ONE of these:**

| Key | What For | Where to Get It | Cost |
|-----|----------|-----------------|------|
| `KIMI_API_KEY` | Lead qualification (vision + text) — **recommended** | [platform.moonshot.cn](https://platform.moonshot.cn/) | ~¥0.70/1M input tokens |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Lead qualification (fallback) | [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/) | $0.15/1M input tokens (gpt-4o-mini) |
| `EXA_API_KEY` | Lead discovery (find companies) — **optional** | [dashboard.exa.ai](https://dashboard.exa.ai/) | $10 free credit on signup |

Optional enrichment keys (skip these initially):

| Key | What For | Free Tier |
|-----|----------|-----------|
| `APOLLO_API_KEY` | Email/phone lookup | 50 credits/month |
| `HUNTER_API_KEY` | Email finder | 25 searches/month |

### 3. Prepare Your Leads

**Option A: Use Exa to discover leads automatically** (requires `EXA_API_KEY`)

```bash
python test_exa.py --export
# Creates output/exa_leads_YYYYMMDD_HHMM_for_qualifier.csv
```

**Option B: Import from LinkedIn Sales Navigator / your own CSV**

Create `input_leads.csv`:

```csv
company_name,website_url,contact_name,linkedin_profile_url
Boston Dynamics,https://www.bostondynamics.com,Marc Raibert,https://linkedin.com/in/marcraibert
Figure AI,https://www.figure.ai,Brett Adcock,
```

**Option C: Use the included sample file**

```bash
cp sample_leads.csv input_leads.csv
```

### 4. Run

```bash
# Quick test with 4 sample companies (Boston Dynamics, Figure AI, Maxon, HubSpot)
python main.py --test

# Process your own leads
python main.py --input input_leads.csv

# Process with deep research on hot leads (more pages crawled, sales brief generated)
python main.py --input input_leads.csv --deep-research

# Text-only mode (no screenshots sent to LLM — cheaper, faster)
python main.py --input input_leads.csv --no-vision

# Start fresh, ignore previous checkpoint
python main.py --input input_leads.csv --clear-checkpoint
```

Or use the convenience script:

```bash
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh test              # Test with sample companies
./run.sh run               # Process input_leads.csv
./run.sh run --deep        # Process with deep research
./run.sh discover          # Run Exa discovery + export CSV
./run.sh export            # Export results to Excel
./run.sh deep 'Maxon' 'https://www.maxongroup.com'  # Deep research one company
```

## How Each Module Works

### `test_exa.py` — Lead Discovery

Uses [Exa AI](https://exa.ai) neural search to find companies matching your ideal customer profile. Exa is like Google but understands *meaning*, not just keywords. Describe the company you want (e.g., "humanoid robot company building actuators") and it returns matching websites.

- **Input:** Natural language search queries (12 pre-built for robotics/motors/magnets)
- **Output:** Company URLs + titles + text snippets + relevance scores
- **Does NOT qualify leads** — just finds them. Qualification is `intelligence.py`'s job.

### `scraper.py` — Web Crawling

Launches a headless Chromium browser via [crawl4ai](https://github.com/unclecode/crawl4ai) to:
- Load the company's homepage
- Extract the full page as clean Markdown text
- Capture a screenshot (for vision model analysis)
- Auto-remove popups/overlays/cookie banners

Screenshots are resized to 720px wide JPEG to keep vision API costs low.

### `intelligence.py` — AI Qualification ⭐ (Core Value)

This is where the magic happens. The LLM:
1. Reads the website markdown text
2. Optionally analyzes the screenshot (vision mode)
3. Scores the company 1-10 on likelihood they need your product
4. Returns structured JSON with: `confidence_score`, `hardware_type`, `industry_category`, `reasoning`, `key_signals`, `red_flags`

**Model priority chain:**
1. **Kimi K2.5** (vision + text) — cheapest option, supports screenshots
2. **OpenAI GPT-4o** (vision fallback)
3. **GPT-4o-mini** (text-only fallback)
4. **Keyword matching** (zero-cost fallback if all APIs fail)

Includes a quick pre-filter that rejects obvious non-hardware companies (SaaS, agencies, consultancies) without burning any LLM tokens.

### `deep_research.py` — Sales Intelligence

For hot leads (score ≥ 8), crawls up to 5 pages on their site and generates:
- Products they manufacture
- Motor types they use (BLDC, stepper, servo, etc.)
- Magnet requirements (NdFeB, SmCo, Halbach)
- Company size and production volume estimates
- Decision-maker titles to target
- A suggested pitch angle and talking points

### `enrichment.py` — Contact Lookup

Two modes:
- **Manual mode** (default): Flags leads for manual LinkedIn/email lookup — zero cost
- **API mode**: Uses Apollo.io and/or Hunter.io to find emails and phone numbers

Start with manual mode. Enable API enrichment once the pipeline is proven and you're ready to do outreach.

### `export.py` — Export & Share

- **Excel:** Creates `.xlsx` with separate sheets for Hot / Review / Rejected
- **Google Sheets:** Uploads directly (requires Google Cloud service account)
- **Watch mode:** Auto-syncs to Sheets when files change

## Configuration Guide

All configuration is in `config.py`. Key settings:

| Setting | Default | What It Controls |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
| `CONCURRENCY_LIMIT` | 5 | How many websites to crawl in parallel |
| `MAX_TOKENS_INPUT` | 6000 | Max tokens of website text sent to LLM per lead |
| `SCORE_HOT_LEAD` | 8 | Minimum score to be classified as a "hot" lead |
| `SCORE_REVIEW` | 4 | Minimum score for "review" bucket (below this → rejected) |
| `TEXT_MODEL` | gpt-4o-mini | LLM for text-only qualification |
| `VISION_MODEL` | kimi-k2.5-thinking | LLM for vision qualification |
| `REQUEST_TIMEOUT` | 30 | Seconds before a crawl times out |

### Customizing the ICP (Ideal Customer Profile)

To target a different industry, edit these in `config.py`:

- **`POSITIVE_KEYWORDS`** — Terms that signal a good-fit company (e.g., "robotics", "BLDC", "actuator")
- **`NEGATIVE_KEYWORDS`** — Terms that signal a bad fit (e.g., "SaaS", "marketing agency", "law firm")
- **`SYSTEM_PROMPT_QUALIFIER`** — The system prompt telling the LLM exactly what makes a good customer
- **`INDUSTRY_CATEGORIES`** — How to classify leads by industry vertical

For Exa discovery queries, edit `LEAD_QUERIES` in `test_exa.py`.

## Cost Estimates

| Operation | Cost per unit | Notes |
|-----------|--------------|-------|
| Exa search (1 query, ≤25 results) | ~$0.005 | 12 queries ≈ $0.06 |
| Exa content retrieval | ~$0.001/page | Included in search call |
| Kimi K2.5 qualification | ~$0.002/lead | Vision + text |
| GPT-4o-mini qualification | ~$0.001/lead | Text only |
| GPT-4o qualification | ~$0.01/lead | With vision |
| Deep research (per lead) | ~$0.005 | 3-5 pages crawled + LLM |
| Apollo enrichment | Free (50/mo) | Then $49/mo for 2,400 |
| Hunter enrichment | Free (25/mo) | Then $49/mo for 500 |

**Typical full run:** 100 leads ≈ **$0.20 – $0.50** with Kimi

## Resume & Checkpointing

The pipeline automatically saves progress. If it crashes or you stop it (`Ctrl+C`):
- Already-processed leads are skipped on re-run
- Output CSVs are appended to, not overwritten
- Checkpoint is stored in `output/.checkpoint.json`

To start completely fresh:
```bash
python main.py --clear-checkpoint
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### "No LLM API configured"
→ Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `KIMI_API_KEY` to your `.env` file.

### Playwright / Chromium errors
```bash
playwright install chromium
# On Linux, also run:
playwright install-deps chromium
```

### Many crawl failures / timeouts
Some sites block headless browsers (Cloudflare, etc.). These leads go to the "review" queue.
- Increase `REQUEST_TIMEOUT` in `config.py` (default: 30s)
- Lower `CONCURRENCY_LIMIT` to avoid rate limits
- Manually visit the site for blocked leads

### Kimi API errors
Kimi K2.5 is a thinking model that requires `temperature=1`. This is already configured. If you see timeout errors, the model may need more time — try increasing the `httpx.Timeout` in `intelligence.py`.

### Stale / wrong results
```bash
python main.py --clear-checkpoint
```
Clears the checkpoint AND output CSVs for a clean run.

### "No EXA_API_KEY found"
The Exa discovery step (`test_exa.py`) is optional. You can skip it entirely and provide your own CSV.
